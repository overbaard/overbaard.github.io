# 1 Prerequisites
You should have read the [User Guide](user-guide.md).

Overbård development started on Jira 7.5.x, and is currently running with no problems on Jira 7.12.0.
You must also have a Jira Software license which adds the Jira Agile functionality. If you don't have a license,
follow these [steps](jira-software-license.md).

Also, this guide assumes that you are familiar with, or able to look up in the Jira documentation, how to configure
the underlying Jira concepts such as setting up projects, tweaking workflows and creating custom fields.

# 2 Installing Overbård

To install Overbård on your Jira instance you need to have the Jira administrator permission.

You can either build it yourself as mentioned in the [Developer Guide](developer-guide.md). But it is easier
to download it from the Overbård [Releases](https://github.com/overbaard/overbaard/releases) page. There is one download for Jira 7 and one for Jira 8. The versioning scheme is `overbaard-jira-plugin-<tgt-jira-version>-<plugin-version>.jar` so overbaard-jira-plugin-8-x.x.x.x.jar targets Jira 8.

Once you have
it on your computer go to go to your Jira instance in the browser and select `Add-Ons` from the settings menu (the
cog in the top-right):
<img src="/assets/images/docs/admin-guide/add-ons-menu.png" width="250px"/>

On the resulting page, click the `Manage apps` link and then the `Upload app` link on the next page (these will only
be visible if you actually are an Jira administrator). In the dialog to `Upload app', select the saved jar.

In the future we might publish the plugin on the Atlassian Marketplace for easier installation.

# 3 Configuration page
Go to your Jira instance, make sure you are logged in and click on the `Overbård` entry in the `Boards` menu.

<img src="/assets/images/docs/common/jira-menu.png" width="500px"/>

You will then be presented with a list of Overbård boards configured on your Jira instance:

<img src="/assets/images/docs/common/boards.png" width="500px"/>

Then click on the hamburger icon in the top left, and select `Config` from the left menu. You will now be presented
with the configuration page, where you can add new boards, and edit the configuration of existing ones. Boards are
configured using JSON, and the syntax will be explained in this guide.

<img src="/assets/images/docs/admin-guide/config-page.png" width="500px"/>

## 3.1 Rank custom field id
An important step is to configure the rank custom field id. To do this, go to
[http://my.jira.org/rest/api/2/field](http://my.jira.org/rest/api/2/field). Substitute
[http://my.jira.org](http://my.jira.org) with the url of your Jira instance. If you are a developer
running Jira locally via the Atlassian SDK, this URL will by default be
[http://localhost:2990/jira/rest/api/2/field](http://localhost:2990/jira/rest/api/2/field). Search for `Rank` and get
the custom field id.

On my local instance this looks like:
```
{"id":"customfield_10005","name":"Rank","custom":true,
"orderable":true,"navigable":true,"searchable":true,
"clauseNames":["cf[10005]","Rank"],"schema":{"type":"any",
"custom":"com.pyxis.greenhopper.jira:gh-lexo-rank","customId":10005}}
```
so the id of the `Rank` custom field is `10005`.

Enter the value you found into the `Rank custom field id` field on the bottom of the configuration page.

Then do the same looking for the `Epic Link` and `Epic Name` custom fields. These are important if you want to
<a href="#enabling-epics">enable epics</a>. On my local instance the `Epic Link` id is `10000` and `Epic Name` is
`10002`.

# 4 Setting up a simple board
The following example discusses how to set up a very basic board, using a project with the standard states
when you create a project in Jira with the `Kanban software development` workflow. Don't worry if you have an existing
project with different states, the concepts are the same.

The full JSON config can be found at
[simple.json](https://overbaard.github.io/overbaard/assets/examples/simple.json). Let's look at it in details,
and describe the main sections.

Note that to set up (or edit) a board you need to either:

* Be a Jira Administrator
* Be a member of a group called 'Overbaard Adminstrators'
* Be a project adminstrator for *all* projects contained in the board configuration

## 4.1 Global config

```
{
  "name": "Simple board",
  "code": "SIMPLE",
```
First we define the `name` of the board, which is what will appear in the list of boards. The `code` is used
in the URL used to link to the boards.

Next we define the states/columns for the board.
```
  "states": [
    {
      "name": "My Backlog",
      "backlog": true
    },
    {
      "name": "My Selected for Development"
    },
    {
      "name": "My In Progress"
    },
    {
      "name": "My Done"
    }
  ],
```
We can call the columns what we like, we will map them later to project states when we choose the projects to include
in the board. Note that the `"backlog": true` setting for the `My backlog` state column means that the column will
be considered the backlog. When loading a board, the backlog column is displayed in a different colour, and is
collapsed by default.

Finally, for this simple example we define the issue priorities and issue types. For most other fields, Overbård will
use the data from the issues to determine the values available for filters and swimlanes. However, for the priorities
and issue types we give them a name and a colour. The name must match the name that shows up in Jira when selecting
either and the colour will appear in the issue card headers. The colour must be something that would be valid
in standard html. Finally, as the priorities and issue types are both arrays,
this determines the order that these entries will show up in the board control panel.
```
  "priorities": [
    {
      "name": "Highest",
      "colour": "red"
    },
    {
      "name": "High",
      "colour": "darkred"
    },
    {
      "name": "Medium",
      "colour": "orange"
    },
    {
      "name": "Low",
      "colour": "greenyellow"
    },
    {
      "name": "Lowest",
      "colour": "green"
    }
  ],
  "issue-types": [
    {
      "name": "Task",
      "colour": "blue"
    },
    {
      "name": "Story",
      "colour": "green"
    },
    {
      "name": "Bug",
      "colour": "red"
    },
    {
      "name": "Epic",
      "colour": "purple"
    }
  ],
```
## 4.2 Projects config
Next we have the configuration of the projects to display on the board. For this simple example we only display
one.
```
  "projects": [
    {
      "code": "PROJ",
```
`code` is the key of the project in Jira that we want to show on the board.
```
      "query-filter": null,
```
`query-filter` is optional, and is not set in this example. Behind the scenes, Overbård will execute a JQL query along the
lines of `project=PROJ [query-filter] ORDER BY Rank` so the `query-filter` is a great way to narrow down the issues
loaded for the board.
```
      "colour": "#4667CA",
```
`colour` specifies the html colour code to use for issues from the specified project.
```
      "state-links": {
        "Backlog" : "My Backlog",
        "Selected for Development" : "My Selected for Development",
        "In Progress" : "My In Progress",
        "Done" : "My Done"
      }
```
Finally we have a `state-links` map which maps the states from the project's workflow to the state column names
we created earlier.
```
    }
  ],
  "linked-projects" : {}
```
The `linked-projects` are not needed, but are left here empty. They will be discussed later.
```
}
```

<a name="enabling-epics"></a>
## 4.2.1 Enabling Epics
By default we don't enable tracking of issues via epics. To turn this on for a project, add
`"enable-epics":true` to the projects you want to enable epics for.
[epics.json](https://overbaard.github.io/overbaard/assets/examples/epics.json)
is a copy of `simple.json` that we have been using so far, and does this for the `PROJ` project (apart from that the
contents of the two files are the same):
```
  "projects": [
    {
      "code": "PROJ",
      "query-filter": null,
      "colour": "#4667CA",
      "enable-epics": true,
```
Epics will now be turned on for the project. When epics are turned on you are able to select `Epics` as one of the
swimlane choices.

```
      "state-links": {
        "Backlog" : "My Backlog",
        "Selected for Development" : "My Selected for Development",
        "In Progress" : "My In Progress",
        "Done" : "My Done"
      }
```

# 5 Board with several projects

The previous section shows a simple board with just one project. We can also add several projects to our board.
The full JSON config can be found at
[several-projects.json](https://overbaard.github.io/overbaard/assets/examples/several-projects.json). Most of
the JSON is the same as in the previous example; the difference is in the `projects` section:
```
  "projects": [
    {
      "code": "PROJ",
      "query-filter": null,
      "colour": "#4667CA",
      "state-links": {
        "Backlog" : "My Backlog",
        "Selected for Development" : "My Selected for Development",
        "In Progress" : "My In Progress",
        "Done" : "My Done"
      }
    },
    {
      "code": "ANOTHER",
      "query-filter": null,
      "colour": "blue",
      "state-links": {
        "TODO": "My Backlog",
        "In Progress": "My In Progress",
        "Complete": "My Done"
      }
    }

  ],
```
As you can see we have added another project called `ANOTHER` to the array of projects to be shown on the board. It has
a different `colour` so we can easily see which issue cards belong to which project on the board. The configuration for
`PROJ` is the same as in the previous example.

It is worth noting that the `ANOTHER` project uses a different workflow from `PROJ`. It has less states, and the states
have different names from the states used in the `PROJ` project.

One thing to note is that there is no overall ranking across projects. Rather issues are presented in rank order for
each project separately. The order of the display of issues by project is the same as their order in the `projects`
array. In other words, for this example, that means that in each column on the board, issues from
`PROJ` will be displayed in rank order, and then the issues from `ANOTHER` will be displayed in rank order.

# 6 Board with advanced headers

We will now have a look at some of the more advanced configuration options to set up the headers.
The full JSON config can be found at
[headers.json](https://overbaard.github.io/overbaard/assets/examples/headers.json). Again we will focus on the
differences from the previous examples:
```
  "states": [
    {
      "name": "Backlog",
      "backlog": true
    },
    {
      "name": "High Priority Backlog",
      "backlog": true,
      "help": "This is the high priority backlog!\n\nSomeone important has decided these are the top priority"
    },
```
Note that there are two `"backlog": true` states in our list of states. These two states will be grouped under a header,
which will be collapsed by default when the board is first loaded. Both states will have the alternative colour used
for the backlog in Overbård.

You can use `"backlog": true` on as many states as you like, but they must all be at the start of the array of states.

The text specified by `help` gives a tooltip that shows up when you hover over the state column header when looking at
the board. The text in `help` can contain newlines, as shown above.

```
    {
      "name": "In Progress",
      "wip": 10,
      "header": "Development"
    },
    {
      "name": "Pull Request Sent",
      "header": "Development",
      "help": "A pull request has been sent"
    },
```
The above two states are grouped using the `header` field. They will still both show up as individual columns,
but will be grouped under a header. The header can be used to collapse/expand all the contained states at the same time.
Note that when using `header` the states must be contiguous, no gaps are allowed.

The `In Progress` state has a wip limit of 10. If the state has more issue than that the column counts in the
header will become red.


```
    {
      "name": "QA TODO",
      "header": "QA"
    },
    {
      "name": "QA In Progress",
      "header": "QA",
      "help": "QA is trying to break the feature"
    },
```
Above we have two states under the `QA` header.
```
    {
      "name": "Verified"
    },
```
Although we have been using headers for our states so far, we don't have to do that for all states. The `Verified`
state shown above does not use headers.
```
    {
      "name": "Closed",
      "done": true
    }
```
The `"done": true` state is a special case. It will *not* be shown on the board! Rather it is a signal for when
we do the project state-links for which issues to ignore
```
  ],
  ...
  "projects": [
    {
      "code": "PROJ",
      "query-filter": null,
      "colour": "#4667CA",
      "state-links": {
        "Backlog": "Backlog",
        "High Priority Backlog": "High Priority Backlog",
        "In Progress": "In Progress",
        "Pull Request Sent": "Pull Request Sent",
        "QA TODO": "QA TODO",
        "QA In Progress": "QA In Progress",
        "Verified": "Verified",
        "Closed": "Closed",
        "Shipped": "Closed"
      }
    }
  ],
```
In our `PROJ` project, we map issues in the `Closed` and `Shipped` states from `PROJ`'s workflow to the `Closed` column
on the board. Remember that the `Closed` column is not actually shown since it is marked with `"done": true`. Rather
what happens, is that when executing the JQL to load the board into the Overbård server-side cache, issues from
these states are omitted. It is a mechanism to not load now irrelevant issues into Overbård.

# 7 Board with custom fields

By default Overbård will automatically populate swimlanes and options for filtering from the issue data for:

* Assignee
* Component
* Label
* Fix Version

In addition it presents the options to use swimlanes and options for filtering issues for (we have seen
in the previous sections that some minimum configuration is needed to set these up):

* Project
* Issue Type
* Priority

However, we can further extend the functionality of Overbård to do this for custom fields. So far (because they were
 needed for managing the JBoss EAP project at Red Hat) it supports two types:

* `version` - For my project we have a custom field called `Target Release`. It is a custom field which allows selection
of one release. The `version` custom field type is suitable for such a custom field.
* `user` - For my project we have a custom fields called `Tester` and `Documenter`. In Jira these are `User Picker (single user)`
custom fields. The `user` custom field type is suitable for such a custom field.
* `single-select` - For my project we have a custom field called `Tested By` which has some pre-defined entries for the various
options. In Jira these are `Select List (single choice)` custom fields. The `single-select` custom field type is suitable
for such a custom field.

If you want support for other types of custom fields, open an [issue](https://github.com/overbaard/overbaard/issues)
and we can discuss the viability.

Let's take a look at how to configure a `Tester` custom field (of type `user`) for a board. The full JSON config
can be found at
[custom-field.json](https://overbaard.github.io/overbaard/assets/examples/custom-field.json). The important parts are discussed below.

In the global part of the configuration we declare the custom fields we are interested in.
```
  "custom": [
    {
      "name": "Tester",
```
`name` is the name that will be used for the field when presented in the list of swimlanes options and in its
corresponding filter header.
```
      "type": "user",
```
We specify that it is of type `user` as discussed above.
```
      "field-id": 121212121212
```
This is the Jira id of the field we are interested in. You can find this by going to
[http://my.jira.org/rest/api/2/field](http://my.jira.org/rest/api/2/field) (adjusting the URL as mentioned earlier),
or by going to the `Issue Types` screen in the Jira Administration section of your Jira instance.
```
    }
  ],
```

Next we configure the custom field for use with projects it should be used for. This is because a board can have
more than one project and custom fields might not be relevant to all of them.

```
  "projects": [
    {
      "code": "PROJ",
      "query-filter": null,
      "colour": "#4667CA",
      "state-links": {
        ...
      },
      "custom": [
        "Tester"
      ]
```
Here we have listed the custom fields that we should use for the `PROJ` project. It is a list of the `name` fields
of the custom fields we want to use for the project. Now when loading the board, Overbård will inspect all issues
in the `PROJ` project and also look for the values of this field, which will be available in the `Tester` filter and
swimlanes!
```
    }
```

# 8 Linked projects/issues

As discussed in the [User Guide](user-guide.md) we can configure a board's issue cards to show links to linked issues
from other projects. This section describes how to do this. The full JSON config
can be found at
[linked-issues.json](https://overbaard.github.io/overbaard/assets/examples/linked-issues.json), and the important
parts are discussed below.

First we need to populate the `linked-issues` section that we have touched upon before:
```
  "linked-projects": {
    "FIRST": {
      "states": [
        "TODO",
        "In Progress",
        "Done"
      ]
    },
    "SECOND": {
      "states": [
        "Backlog",
        "In Progress",
        "QA",
        "Verified"
      ]
    }
  }
```
We have declared two projects that we are interested in: `FIRST` and `SECOND`. For each project, we list the
states from their individual workflows. These are listed in order, and are used as a lookup to determine a colour
for the linked issue in board issue it is linked to from. For example a `SECOND` issue in the `Backlog` state will appear
as red, and a `SECOND` issue in `Verified` will appear as green.

Next we need to reference these linked projects from our main projects. Again we might have more than one project
configured for the board, and they might have different interests in which issues from the linked projects they should
display. In the following example the `PROJ` project is set up to reference both linked projects, via the `linked-issues`
field. The `linked-issues` field has a `filter` attribute that can be used to narrow down which issues are selected.
```
  "projects": [
    {
      "code": "PROJ",
      "query-filter": null,
      "colour": "#4667CA",
      "state-links": {
        ...
      },
      "linked-issues": [
        {
          "projects": [
            "FIRST"
```
We are interested in issues from the `FIRST` linked project. Although this list just contains one entry, we could have
added more.
```
          ],
          "filter": {}
```
The filter is empty so any issue from `FIRST` linked to by `PROJ` issues will be shown on the board.
```
        },
        {
          "projects": [
            "SECOND"
```
Here we are interested in issues from the `SECOND` project.
```
          ],
          "filter": {
            "issue-types": [
              "Bug",
              "Task"
            ],
            "priorities": [
              "Highest"
            ],
            "labels": [
              "Upstream_feature"
            ],
            "link-names": [
              "cloned to",
              "cloned from"
            ]
          }
```
This filter specifies that the `PROJ` issue cards should include linked issues from the `SECOND` project but only if the
linked `SECOND` issue:
* has a type of `Bug` or `Task`, and
* has a priority of `Highest`, and
* is labelled with the `Upstream_feature` label, and
* the link type is either `cloned to` or `cloned from`

You can use as few or as many of these fields as you like to narrow down exactly which linked issues you are interested
in.
```
        }
      ]
    }
```

# 9 Manual swimlanes
The [User Guide](user-guide.md) talks about the various swimlanes that get enabled automatically when setting up an
Overbård board. However, you can also set up additional swimlanes manually for more targetted views for your users.
To do this you add the `manual-swimlanes` section to your board config and add entries to it.
```
  "manual-swimlanes": [
    {
      "name": "Manual Swimlane",
      "entries" : [
        {
          "name": "High priority bugs",
          "issue-ql": "priority IN ('Highest', 'High') AND type = 'Bug'"
        },
        {
          "name": "High priority tasks",
          "issue-ql": "priority IN ('Highest', 'High') AND type = 'Task' s"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
```
In the `Swimlane` drop-down list in the control panel, the user will now see an additonal entry called `Manual Swimlanes`
(after `Search`, `Project`, `Issue Type` etc.), and when selecting that swimlane view they will have two lanes, the first
called `High priority bugs` and the second called `High priority tasks` (at the end there will be also be a
`None` swimlane for all issues which are not part of either of the two manually configured swimlanes).
Each swimlane entry contains an `issue-ql` entry. This is an 'Issue QL' string used to pick out issues we want
to be displayed in each swimlane. For more information about Issue QL, see the [Issue QL Guide](issue-ql.md).

# 10 Parallel tasks

As mentioned in the [User Guide](user-guide.md) Overbård has a feature called Parallel Tasks. The way we use them on
the EAP project is that there are a set of requirements worked on by different teams that should be satisfied by the time
we merge a feature. Some of these are:
* Analysis Document - it needs to be written and agreed upon by the different stakeholders
* Documentation  - it needs to be written, and reviewed by the various teams
* Test Development - Done by the QE team along with the development of the feature
* Pre-Check - Once the feature is complete, QE checks that the new tests work and that no regressions are introduced.

These are things which:
* need to be done for all new features
* often involve cross-team collaboration
* each have more than one state (so a simple checkbox won't do). E.g. the Analysis Document Parallel Task has the states
`TODO`, `In Progress`, `Review`, `Approved`
* if split up into Jira sub-tasks would seriously clutter up the board, with no immediate view of how each issue's
tasks are progressing.

To set up Parallel Tasks in Overbård, you first need to configure a custom field for each Parallel Task in Jira. The
custom fields must be of the type `Select List (single choice)`. For each field give them the values you want (in the
Analysis Document example mentioned, you would specify `TODO`, `In Progress`, `Review` and `Approved` ), and set the
first one as the default value. The order of the values is important and should be from start to finish, as the colour
shown for each parallel task on the issue cards gives an indication of how far the task has progressed, with red being
`not started` (i.e. the first ) value and green being the `finished` (i.e. the last) value.

Then associate these custom fields with the screens for your project.

Then in Overbård we configure the Parallel Tasks as shown in
[parallel-tasks.json](https://overbaard.github.io/overbaard/assets/examples/parallel-tasks.json).
The notable parts follow:
```
  "parallel-tasks": {
    "fields": [
      {
        "name": "Analysis Document",
        "type": "parallel-task-progress",
        "field-id": 121212121212,
        "display": "AD"
      },
      {
        "name": "Documentation",
        "type": "parallel-task-progress",
        "field-id": 121212121213,
        "display": "DC"
      },
      {
        "name": "Test Development",
        "type": "parallel-task-progress",
        "field-id": 121212121214,
        "display": "TD"
      },
      {
        "name": "Pre-Checked",
        "type": "parallel-task-progress",
        "field-id": 121212121215,
        "display": "PC"
      }
    ]
  },
```
Similar to custom fields, we define all the parallel tasks in the `parallel-tasks` section in the global
part of the configuration. Each parallel task has:
* a `name`, which is displayed in the board filters in the control panel
* a `type` which is always `parallel-task-progress`
* a `field-id` which is the id of the custom field, which you
can find by going to [http://my.jira.org/rest/api/2/field](http://my.jira.org/rest/api/2/field)
(adjusting the URL as mentioned earlier).
* a `display` value. This is a two letter code which appears for each
parallel task in the parallel task section in the issue cards. Note that we are not configuring any values for the
parallel tasks here, those are loaded from each of the custom field configuration that we set up earlier in this section.

Next, we need to associate the parallel tasks for the project (on a board where we have more than one project, each
project might have different or intersecting parallel task requirements):

```
  "projects": [
    {
      "code": "PROJ",
      "query-filter": null,
      "colour": "#4667CA",
      "state-links": {
        ...
      },
      "parallel-tasks": [
        [
          "Analysis Document",
          "Documentation"
        ],
        [
          "Test Development",
          "Pre-Checked"
        ]
      ]
    }
```
Note that the parallel tasks are grouped, so that `AD` (Analysis Document) and `DC` (Documentation) will appear in
one group and `TD` (Test Development) and `PC` (Pre-Checked) will appear in another.

# 11 Issue type overrides

This a slightly more advanced topic, which builds on what we have learnt so far. We have seen how to map project states
to the Overbård columns, and how to configure parallel tasks and linked issues on a per project basis. However, for the
state mappings, different issue types can have different workflows which in turn means a set of different states.
Similarly, parallel tasks and linked issues may be relevant to one issue type but not the others, or different issue
types might have different parallel task and linked issue needs.

# 11.1 State mapping overrides
[state-mapping-overrides.json](https://overbaard.github.io/overbaard/assets/examples/state-mapping-overrides.json)
shows a sample config for configuring different state mappings for different issue types.

In short what the below snippet does is define different state mappings for issues which have the type
`Task` or `Bug`. Issues which do not have these issue type have the standard state mappings.

```
  "projects": [
    {
      "code": "PROJ",
      "query-filter": null,
      "colour": "#4667CA",
      "state-links": {
        "Backlog": "Backlog",
        "Selected for Development": "Selected for Development",
        "In Progress": "In Progress",
        "Done": "Done"
      },
      "overrides": {
        "state-links": [
          {
            "issue-types": ["Task", "Bug"],
            "override": {
              "TODO" : "Backlog",
              "In Progress" : "In Progress",
              "Verified": "Done"
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ],
```

# 11.2 Parallel task overrides
[parallel-task-overrides.json](https://overbaard.github.io/overbaard/assets/examples/parallel-task-overrides.json)
shows a JSON config for setting up
different parallel tasks for different issue types.

The set up of the parallel tasks in the global section of the configuration is the same as we have seen before. The
example uses a board with two projects to be able to show all permutations in one example.


```
  "projects": [
    {
      "code": "PROJ",
      "query-filter": null,
      "colour": "#4667CA",
      "state-links": {
        ...
      },
      "parallel-tasks": [
        [
          "Analysis Document",
          "Documentation"
        ],
        [
          "Test Development",
          "Pre-Checked"
        ]
      ],
```
The above are the parallel tasks for issues in the `PROJ` project. These will be used for issue types
that there are no overrides for. (As we have overrides for `Task`, `Story` and `Bug`, in effect this means that only
issues that have the type `Epic` will use these default parallel tasks).
```
      "overrides": {
        "parallel-tasks": [
          {
            "issue-types": ["Task", "Story"],
            "override": [
              [
                "Analysis Document",
                "Documentation"
              ]
            ]
          },
```
Issues in project `PROJ` that have an issue type of `Task` or `Story` only use the `Analysis Document` and
`Documentation` parallel tasks.
```
          {
            "issue-types": ["Bug"],
            "override": null
          }
```
Issues in project `PROJ` that have an issue type of `Bug` have parallel tasks disabled.
```
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      "code": "ANOTHER",
      "query-filter": null,
      "colour": "blue",
      "state-links": {
        ...
      },
```
In the `ANOTHER` project, there are no project wide parallel tasks configured. There is an override for the
issue type `Task`, so that issues of that type will have the parallel tasks shown below. Issues of any other type
will not have parallel tasks.
```
      "overrides": {
        "parallel-tasks": [
          {
            "issue-types": ["Task"],
            "override": [
              [
                "Analysis Document",
                "Documentation"
              ],
              [
                "Test Development",
                "Pre-Checked"
              ]
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ],
```

# 11.3 Linked issue overrides
[linked-issue-overrides.json](https://overbaard.github.io/overbaard/assets/examples/linked-issue-overrides.json)
shows a JSON config for setting up
different parallel tasks for different issue types. As before let's look at the `linked-projects` section first. It
looks a lot like it did before but `SECOND` has a new `type-states` map. This is needed if the `SECOND` project
has different workflows for different issue types. As mentioned the earlier the state of the linked issue is used to
calculate a colour for the linked issue (with red denoting the first state, and green the last state). If the linked
issue from the `SECOND` project has the type `Task` or `Bug` the relevant set of states will be used to calculate the
colour. For all other issue types, the list of states in the `states` field will be used.

```
  "linked-projects": {
    "FIRST": {
      "states": [
        "TODO",
        "In Progress",
        "Done"
      ]
    },
    "SECOND": {
      "states": [
        "Backlog",
        "In Progress",
        "QA",
        "Verified"
      ],
      "type-states": {
        "Task": ["TODO", "In Progress", "Done"],
        "Bug": ["TODO", "Doing", "Done"]
      }
    }
  }
```

The above is an extra dimension to overrides for linked issues. The next part is similar to what we already saw for
parallel task and state mapping overrides:

```
  "projects": [
    {
      "code": "PROJ",
      "query-filter": null,
      "colour": "#4667CA",
      "state-links": {
        "Backlog": "Backlog",
        "Selected for Development": "Selected for Development",
        "In Progress": "In Progress",
        "Done": "Done"
      },
      "linked-issues": [
        {
          "projects": [
            "FIRST"
          ],
          "filter": {
            "priorities": ["High"]
          }
        }
      ],
      "overrides": {
        "linked-issues": [
          {
            "issue-types": ["Story"],
            "override": [
              {
                "projects": ["FIRST"],
                "filter": null
              },
              {
                "projects": ["SECOND"],
                "filter": {
                  "priorities": ["High"]
                }
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
```
Here we have an override for when the `PROJ` issue is of type Story, and a `linked-issues` setting for the project.
If the issue type is *not* `Story` we will display all linked issues from the `FIRST` linked project where the priority
is `High`. If the issue type is `Story`, we do not display linked issues from the `FIRST` project, and display all
linked issues from the `SECOND` project where the priority is `High`.
```
    },
    {
      "code": "ANOTHER",
      "query-filter": null,
      "colour": "blue",
      "state-links": {
        "Backlog": "Backlog",
        "Selected for Development": "Selected for Development",
        "In Progress": "In Progress",
        "Done": "Done"
      },
      "overrides": {
        "linked-issues": [
          {
            "issue-types": ["Story"],
            "override": [
              {
                "projects": ["FIRST"],
                "filter": {
                  "priorities": ["Highest"]
                }
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
```
For the `ANOTHER` project there is no `linked-issues` setting for the project, but there is an override for when the
issue type is `Story`. So, if the `ANOTHER` issue type is `Story` we link to issues from the `FIRST` project that have
the `Highest` priority. Issues with other issue types in the `ANOTHER` project do not get linked issues displayed on
the board.
```
    }
  ],
```

# 12 Diagnosing problems

When entering the board configuration, if you have got something wrong the server will validate the JSON to see if it
is valid configuration. It will also (at least in most cases!) display an error message to help you pinpoint what went
wrong.

## 12.1 Health Panel

Once you have successfully saved the board config, if you go and view the board, you might get a message about an error
having happened loading the board, and be asked to view the health panel. The health panel is accessed by clicking
the alarm clock icon in the bottom right. This icon will only be shown if there actually is a problem.

The health panel will list issues that there is a problem with, and it will be due to either:
* an issue loaded which has a type not configured in the `issue-types` section in the global configuration
* an issue loaded which has a priority not configured in the `priorities` section in the global configuration
* an issue loaded which has a state not configured in the project or the relevant overrides `state-links` map.

To get rid of the health panel warning, go in and add the issue type, priority or the missing state.

# 13 Configuration History

Generally the configuration validation will pick up on bad configurations before it is stored to the database. However,
accidents can still happen. You might change your configuration into something not working, or you might end up accidentally
deleting it. To help deal with these situations, you can access the configuration history. It is not currently exposed in the
UI, but you can view the REST URLs in the browser (just make sure you are logged into Jira), as this is hopefully not
something you will need to use very often!

The entry point URL is `http://my.jira.org/rest/overbaard/1.0/board-config-history` (In the below examples `http://my.jira.org/` is
`http://localhost:2990/jira` as I have taken them from running the SDK locally).

When I go to that URL I get something like:
```
{
    "next" : "http://localhost:2990/jira/rest/overbaard/1.0/board-config-history?from=16",
    "entries" : [
        {
            "id" : 20,
            "code" : "TSTx",
            "board_id" : 4,
            "changed_by" : "admin",
            "change_type" : "Updated",
            "time" : "2019-04-18T15:56+0100",
            "url" : "http://localhost:2990/jira/rest/overbaard/1.0/board-config-history/20"
        },
        {
            "id" : 19,
            "code" : "Tmp",
            "board_id" : 28,
            "changed_by" : "admin",
            "change_type" : "Deleted",
            "time" : "2019-04-18T15:45+0100",
            "url" : "http://localhost:2990/jira/rest/overbaard/1.0/board-config-history/19"
        },
        {
            "id" : 17,
            "code" : "Tmp",
            "board_id" : 28,
            "changed_by" : "admin",
            "change_type" : "Created",
            "time" : "2019-04-18T15:36+0100",
            "url" : "http://localhost:2990/jira/rest/overbaard/1.0/board-config-history/17"
        }
        ...
```
You can also specify the board id in the `board_id` query parameter, i.e.
`http://localhost:2990/jira/rest/overbaard/1.0/board-config-history?board_id=4` narrows down the results to each one
```
{
    "next" : "http://localhost:2990/jira/rest/overbaard/1.0/board-config-history?from=8&board_id=4",
    "entries" : [
        {
            "id" : 20,
            "code" : "TSTx",
            "board_id" : 4,
            "changed_by" : "admin",
            "change_type" : "Updated",
            "time" : "2019-04-18T15:56+0100",
            "url" : "http://localhost:2990/jira/rest/overbaard/1.0/board-config-history/20"
        },
        {
            "id" : 15,
            "code" : "TST",
            "board_id" : 4,
            "changed_by" : "admin",
            "change_type" : "Updated",
            "time" : "2019-04-17T22:13+0100",
            "url" : "http://localhost:2990/jira/rest/overbaard/1.0/board-config-history/15"
        },
        ...
```
We use the `board_id` rather than its `code` for this, as when you update a board you can change its `code`, while the
`board_id` is its primary key in the backing database. The number of results are limited (currently hardcoded to 50),
with basic paging via the url in the `next` field.

For each history entry we have the following fields:
* `id` - the primary key of the history entry
* `code` - the current code of the board
* `board_id` - the primary key of the board itself
* `changed_by` - the Jira key of the user who made the change
* `change_type` - `Created`, `Updated` or `Deleted`
* `time` - The date and time the board config was changed
* `url` - a url to get more detail about the change. We will look more at this in the next sub-section

## 13.1 Config history detail

Going into `http://localhost:2990/jira/rest/overbaard/1.0/board-config-history/20` you will be presented with something
like:
```
{
    "id" : 20,
    "name" : "Test board",
    "code" : "TSTx",
    "owner" : "admin",
    "board_id" : 4,
    "changed_by" : "admin",
    "change_type" : "Updated",
    "time" : "2019-04-18T15:56+0100",
    "config" : {
        "name" : "Test board",
        "code" : "TSTx",
        "states" : [
            {
```
All the fields here have the same meaning as described above. We have some additional fields which have the following
meanings:
* `name` - the name of the board
* `owner` - the 'owner' of the board (really the last person to update the config)
* `config` - a copy of the configuration entered in the board configuration page. When the `change_type` is either
`Created` or `Updated`, it contains the config that was saved. When the `change_type` is `Deleted`, this field contains
the configuration as it was before the entry was deleted.
